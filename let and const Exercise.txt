let and const Exercise
In this exercise, youâ€™ll refactor some ES5 code into ES2015.

ES5 Global Constants
var PI = 3.14;
PI = 42; // stop me from doing this!

const PI = 3.14;
// PI = 42; // This line will throw an error in ES2015 and prevent reassignment.



ES2015 Global Constants
/* Write an ES2015 Version */

const PI = 3.14;
// PI = 42; // This line will throw an error in ES2015 and prevent reassignment.




Quiz
1. Difference between `var` and `let`:
   - `var` is function-scoped, while `let` is block-scoped.
   - `var` allows variable redeclaration within the same scope, while `let` does not.

2. Difference between `var` and `const`:
   - `var` allows variable reassignment, while `const` does not.
   - `var` variables are not limited to the block scope, while `const` variables are block-scoped.

3. Difference between `let` and `const`:
   - `let` allows variable reassignment, while `const` does not.
   - `let` variables are block-scoped, just like `const` variables.

4. Hoisting:
   - Hoisting is a JavaScript behavior where variable and function declarations are moved to the top of their containing scope during the compilation phase.
   - Variables declared with `var` are hoisted and initialized with a value of `undefined`.
   - Variables declared with `let` and `const` are also hoisted but are not initialized until their declaration statement is encountered during runtime.
